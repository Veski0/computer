# computer

A set of lua files for Computer Craft.

Use the links in json.lua and git.lua to pull git support onto a computer using wget. You can then use git to bootstrap repositories onto the computer.

## style

Code must attempt to fit into a 40x13 window if possible. This allows source code to be easily read inside Minecraft.
